# Meteor Socialize Demo #

The start of a quick demo of the socialize packages for meteor. At the moment it is pretty basic, but has a login/register page, user feed, messaging, profiles, and friend requests. There is quite a bit more to be added and a ton of polish to apply still. This is very much a work in progress and you are welcome to help it along with issues and pull requests.

## Setup ##

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/copleykj/meteor-socialize-demo.git

```

## Running ##

```
