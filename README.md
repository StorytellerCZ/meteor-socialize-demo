# Meteor Socialize Demo #

The start of a quick demo of the socialize packages for meteor. At the moment it's basically just scaffolded. I'll be adding more shortly.

Currently the versions of the packages this demo relies on aren't released on atmosphere. Run the `getPackages.sh` file to clone them at their `devel` branches.

## Setup ##

1. Clone this repository
2. Locate `getPackages.sh` in the project dir, chmod +x and execute
3. run `meteor npm install`

## Running ##

```shell
$ meteor run
```

This project is very basic at the moment with only register/login/logout functionality. Feel free to contribute by adding features or fixing bugs as I progress.

## Contributing ##

This repo contains ESLint and Editor configurations. Please use them so I don't have to fight your code :-P
